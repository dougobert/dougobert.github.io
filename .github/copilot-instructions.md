## Development Guidelines

### Hugo Site Structure
When working with Hugo files, follow these conventions:
- Use `config.toml` for site configuration
- Store theme images in `static/images/` directory
- Create content in appropriate subdirectories: `content/gallery/`, `content/blog/`, etc.


### E-commerce Integration
- Implement payment links using Stripe Payment Links
- Embed buy buttons directly in photo captions or descriptions
- Support multiple product types: prints, digital downloads, licenses
- Example Stripe integration: `<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/...">Buy Print â€“ $20</a>`

### Contact Forms
- Use static form services (Formspree, Formsubmit, or Netlify Forms)
- Implement proper form validation and user feedback
- Example form structure:
  ```html
  <form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">
    <label>Your email: <input type="email" name="email"></label>
    <label>Message: <textarea name="message"></textarea></label>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
  ```

### Content Management
- Use Markdown for all content creation
- Include proper frontmatter for SEO and organization
- Tag blog posts and gallery collections appropriately
- Maintain consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Use GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Target Hugo version 0.125.0 or later
- Ensure proper baseURL configuration for GitHub Pages
- Include submodule support for themes

### Performance and SEO
- Compress and optimize all images before upload
- Use WebP format where possible
