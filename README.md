## Architecture

  - `static/images/`: Theme and profile images.
  - `layouts/`: Custom templates for galleries, single photo pages, and partials (breadcrumbs, share buttons).
  - `themes/PaperMod/`: Theme as a git submodule.
- **Automation**:
  - `scripts/organize_gallery.py`: Python script to organize photos and generate `index.md` files.
  - `.github/workflows/organize-gallery.yml`: Workflow to run the script and commit changes.
- **Config**:
  - `hugo.yaml`: Site configuration, theme settings, and feature toggles (e.g., ShowExifData).
- **Deployment**:
  - GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
